	2. sequence number which is eigth bits wide. This means

	3. direction, whether we are reading or writing 
	4. size it is the size of user data involved.
	   generally 8 to 14 bits long
	   
   To arrive at unique numbers easily we use the following macros
   _IO(type, nr);
   _IOW(type, nr, dataitem) the fourth item calculated using sizeof 
   _IOR(type, nr, dataitem)
   _IOWR(type, nr, dataitem)
